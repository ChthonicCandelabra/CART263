# PROJECT 1 ~ PARTICLES WITH PERSONALITIES

## THEME: Breaking up with a lover

Start with pastel pink
Progress to bright blood red(?) and fade into dark purple or black. Maybe pale blue to imply a sense of cold.

Thinking of the "loves me, loves me not" saying. Falling flower petals? Wilting rose? Turning to dust or burning or both?

Should the user be able to pick off petals with the mouse?

Sad music? Noises? Crying sounds? Vocals?

Rose petals wilt as the user picks them off?
