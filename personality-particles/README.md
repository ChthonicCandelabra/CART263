# PROJECT 1 ~ PARTICLES WITH PERSONALITIES

## THEME: Breaking up with a lover

Circles representing petals move in a circle as they decay into bright red, eventually dissapearing as the background turns black.

Mouse detection was attempted but the moving circle made it a much more difficult task.

Ideally, particles would decay one at a time rather than all at once.
