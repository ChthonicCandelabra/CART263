# Data Visualization: Sleep Qaulity

I noticed that often data visualization relies on many different objects to display its findings. This makes sense, as it conveys large sums of data quickly through visuals. However, for this project I wanted to simplify and have one main "object" as the center of attention.

Originally I planned for this object to be a png file of a sheep, as the data set I chose was a sleep qaulity survey and "counting sheep" came to mind. But I really wanted to work with colours, and I didn't really want to bother with the tint image function so I stuck to a circle. 

It's very simple and so is the code, but I think it's elegant in this way. As the data is displayed with shape and colour; sleep duration is the size of the circle and the qaulity/efficiency is the colour.

I struggled because I had to really scale the examples I was looking at down, I didn't realize how much simpler the code was actually going to be. The original data set was also bigger but I removed some columns I knew I wasn't going to use.

*I'm not sure why it doesn't work considering the data set values from the for loops load fine and its also laggy on my end but I'm unsure how to remedy that
